# SQRL
Jihad Khan and I (Kyle Oliver) utilized a Muse 1 and its no longer supported sdk to make a program that will call your phone if you start to fall asleep.

We started designing SQRL (pronounced like squirrel) during RevolutionUC's 5th Hackathon on March 2, 2019. The concept started out as an accessibility platform that would have various tools and helpers. One tool that was considered was an app that would help people with adhd to stay on track and focus on a project, leading to the project's name: SQRL (squirrel).
